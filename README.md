Function quadratic_equation return quadratic equations using variables a, b и с. If equations have no solutions - return None.

# How to use

```bash
# import function
from quadratic_equation import get_roots
# call it using variables
get_roots(a, b, c)
```

# How to launch the test

```bash

$ python tests.py # possibly requires call of python3 executive instead of just python

```

The same with Windows environment;
